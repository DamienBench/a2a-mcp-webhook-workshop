We have robust Slack integration capabilities. I'll share more details about that.\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: Great. We're also using GitHub for tracking our development workflow.

We're excited to discuss how our AI platform could help with your automation needs.\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: Thanks for setting this up. We've been looking for a solution to automate our development workflows.\n\nVivek Raghunathan: Yes, particularly around code reviews and bug triage. Our team is spending too much time on these tasks.\n\nSarah: I understand. Our platform has specific features for development workflows. Let me show you how it works.\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: That looks promising. One question - we found a bug in our trial where the AI sometimes misclassifies the severity of bugs.\n\nSarah: I'll make a note of that and have our engineers look into it. I'll create a bug report for this issue.\n\nVivek Raghunathan: Also, we'd like to integrate this with our Slack channels for team notifications. Is that possible?\n\nSarah: Absolutely! We have robust Slack integration capabilities. I'll share more details about that.\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: Great. We're also using GitHub for tracking our development workflow. Can your system integrate with GitHub for issue management?\n\nSarah: Yes, we offer GitHub integration as well. I'll send you documentation on that.\n\nVivek Raghunathan: This sounds like it could work for us. What would the next steps be?\n\nSarah: I'll send a proposal with pricing and implementation details by tomorrow. Should I include anyone else?\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: Please add our VP of Engineering to the proposal. I'll share their contact details after the call.\n\nSarah: Perfect! Thank you for your time today. I look forward to working with Snowflake.\n",

We're excited to discuss how our AI platform could help with your automation needs.\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: Thanks for setting this up. We've been looking for a solution to automate our development workflows.\n\nVivek Raghunathan: Yes, particularly around code reviews and bug triage. Our team is spending too much time on these tasks.\n\nSarah: I understand. Our platform has specific features for development workflows. Let me show you how it works.\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: That looks promising. One question - we found a bug in our trial where the AI sometimes misclassifies the severity of bugs.\n\nSarah: I'll make a note of that and have our engineers look into it. I'll create a bug report for this issue.\n\nVivek Raghunathan: Also, we'd like to integrate this with our Slack channels for team notifications. Is that possible?\n\nSarah: Absolutely! We have robust Slack integration capabilities. I'll share more details about that.\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: Great. We're also using GitHub for tracking our development workflow. Can your system integrate with GitHub for issue management?\n\nSarah: Yes, we offer GitHub integration as well. I'll send you documentation on that.\n\nVivek Raghunathan: This sounds like it could work for us. What would the next steps be?\n\nSarah: I'll send a proposal with pricing and implementation details by tomorrow. Should I include anyone else?\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: Please add our VP of Engineering to the proposal. I'll share their contact details after the call.\n\nSarah: Perfect! Thank you for your time today. I look forward to working with Snowflake.\n",

We're excited to discuss how our AI platform could help with your automation needs.\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: Thanks for setting this up. We've been looking for a solution to automate our development workflows.\n\nVivek Raghunathan: Yes, particularly around code reviews and bug triage. Our team is spending too much time on these tasks.\n\nSarah: I understand. Our platform has specific features for development workflows. Let me show you how it works.\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: That looks promising. One question - we found a bug in our trial where the AI sometimes misclassifies the severity of bugs.\n\nSarah: I'll make a note of that and have our engineers look into it. I'll create a bug report for this issue.\n\nVivek Raghunathan: Also, we'd like to integrate this with our Slack channels for team notifications. Is that possible?\n\nSarah: Absolutely! We have robust Slack integration capabilities. I'll share more details about that.\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: Great. We're also using GitHub for tracking our development workflow. Can your system integrate with GitHub for issue management?\n\nSarah: Yes, we offer GitHub integration as well. I'll send you documentation on that.\n\nVivek Raghunathan: This sounds like it could work for us. What would the next steps be?\n\nSarah: I'll send a proposal with pricing and implementation details by tomorrow. Should I include anyone else?\n\nSubramanian Muralidhar: Please add our VP of Engineering to the proposal. I'll share their contact details after the call.\n\nSarah: Perfect! Thank you for your time today. I look forward to working with Snowflake.\n",
