# Webhook Server Implementation Plan

## Overview
We're building a webhook server that:
1. Accepts POST requests at paths like `/webhook/abc123`
2. Logs the request body to the console
3. Sends the webhook data to the host agent for processing
4. Uses JSON config files to determine how the host agent should process the data
5. Provides a web UI to:
   - Display all agents and their status
   - Show and edit webhook configurations
   - Test webhooks
