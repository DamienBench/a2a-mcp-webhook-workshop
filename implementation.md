## Progress Tracking

All tasks have been completed successfully. The repository is now cleaned up and well-documented according to the spec requirements.

The Host Agent has been updated to match the A2A protocol more closely, fixing the import errors and ensuring proper response formats. The agent now correctly routes requests to the appropriate specialized agents (Slack, GitHub, Salesforce) using both pattern matching and the Gemini LLM for intelligent request analysis.

Major Improvements in Host Agent:
1. Implemented a tool-based system for agent routing, following Google's A2A Python example
2. Added session tracking to maintain context between turns
3. Improved error handling and response formatting
4. Fixed TypeScript type issues and linter errors
5. Enhanced the system prompt to guide the LLM in proper tool usage
6. Properly registered tools with the correct types using GoogleGenerativeAI
7. Renamed tools to match the Python example (`list_remote_agents` and `send_task`)
8. Used correct generateContent API with proper function calling parameters
9. Added extensive debugging to track request routing
10. Implemented pattern recognition fallback for when tool calls aren't used by the LLM
11. Added direct pattern matching as first routing step for common queries
12. Fixed Express routing with proper Router middleware
13. Added clear TypeScript interfaces for function call typing
14. Migrated to A2AServer implementation for consistency with sub-agents
15. Added comprehensive documentation with architecture diagrams

Final Architecture:
- Host Agent on port 41240: Central coordinator that routes requests
- Slack Agent on port 41243: Handles Slack messaging
- GitHub Agent on port 41245: Creates GitHub issues
- Salesforce Agent on port 41244: Manages Salesforce records
